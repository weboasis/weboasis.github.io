##### January 4th 2022 Sorry & Goodbye

Webby posted in the WebOasis [forum](https://weboas.is/forum/index.php?topic=5760.0) that he can no longer run the website and has published the source of the website for everyone.

He mentioned in the blog post that he has taken his life.

> I just need to get away from this world forever. Clearly I’m not compatible. I'm sorry to my friends and family that will have to find me like this, but it's the only way forward. I’ve been at a low point in my life the past two months and don’t foresee it getting any better. In fact it seems to be spiraling out of control even more.

> Also, don’t you dare blame this on guns. Someone determined to take their own life would find a way to do it one way or another.
